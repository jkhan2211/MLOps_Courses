## ML Ops and ML Pipelines- Theory
- Convert Business Problem into ML Problem 

Type of ML Deployment
- Batch: In Batch Deployment, ML models process large volumes of data at scheduled intervals, ideal for tasks like end-of-day reporting or monthly analytics

- Stream: Stream deployment enable ML models to process and analyze data in real-time as it flows in suitable for application like fraud detection or live social media analysis

- Realtime: Realtime deployment allow ML models to provide instant predictions or decisions in response to incoming data, essential for use cases like recommendation system or autonomous driving

- Edge: Edge deployment involve running ML model on local devices, close to data source, reducing latency and bandwidth usage, which is crucial to IoT, application and smart devices.

### Benefits of ML Pipeline
- Do not keep maintaining the model, once you deploy you can monitor-> Automation, Scalability, Enhance, Customer analysis and customer satisfaction 
- Improve data
### Challenges in ML Model Deployment
Major Challenges in model training and validation: 
- Not enough training data
- Poor quality data
- Overfitting

- Underfitting 
- Unrelated or irellavant features


### Data and Model Management
- Data pipelines: Build and maintain data pipelines for continuous data flow.
- Model Versioning: Tracking and managing different version of models


### A/B Testing for ML Model
- Check if model doing good or not

Objective comparison
Real world application
Statistical significance


### ML Model Bias and Security 
Security:
- ensuring security, involving protective sensitive data from unauthorize access
- secure APIs
- access controls
Compliance:
- GDPR or HIPAA
- ethical use of data in machine learning deployments
Bias Detection:
- Identify and mitigate bias in ML model
- involves using diverse training datasets
- applying fariness-awarenes algorithims

Continuous Monitoring
- Regular monitor and update deploy model
- compliance and fairness
- performace tracking, alert automated alert for anomalies
